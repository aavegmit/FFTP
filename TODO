Noticed a one-two sec delay after WriteToFile thread exits. Try reducing that

Duplicate packets still showing up. Should be close to zero

put a gettimeofday around getPacketFromseq numb function in prepareBlock thread and analyse it for diff packet size

put a gettimeofday around handleAckList

Not working on deter

BUG: Server udp write thread is now so quick that it starts sending packets, but the client is not ready...to have a new TCP message from client to the server notfiying the server that the client is now ready to receive data
	Temp fix - Put a sleep where we start out prepare block threads

Feature: Send a termination TCP message to the server indicating that the transfer is complete
